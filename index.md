## Introduction

The purpose of this "University" is to teach you how to program. We start from the very basics: systems. The first session you should take is [SYS101 - Introduction to Systems](./Systems/sys101/).

You can browse available sessions by clicking on **Sessions** in the upper left hand corner.

## Why Iterative University?

We are into mastery in learning. Mastery in learning requires people to get "perfect marks" in a subject before they can move on to the next subject. This is often best done with small iterations where each iteration builds up on knowledge from prior iterations. Hence, why we call our "University" Iterative University or IterUni for short.
